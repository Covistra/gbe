{Scene:1, start:true, lang:en, rating:E, title:"Background"}
A deep fog has settled down as you gradually reduce the speed of your car. You have been traveling for over an hour, and the pace has now become intolerably slow. You glance at the time reading on your console- a half hour before midnight. Strange that someone would need a presentation at this hour, your think to yourself. You quickly glance down at the name on the order- Pravemi. It’s odd that you’ve never heard about this name, but then again, you’ve only been employed by your company for a week. The work has been good so far; you’ve averaged six presentations a day and closed the sale on over half of them. So if some eccentric individual wants a presentation at this hour of the night, does it really matter? No sir. If it goes through, then you will have capped off a good week.
{para}Still, the situation is rather strange. You haven’t seen a house, or any kind of building for that matter, for quite some time.  You turned off your radio miles ago, as static flooded the airwaves.  You estimate that at this rate, by the time you find the location, make your presentation, and get back home, time will have elapsed into the wee hours of the early dawn. Oh well, you think, as the fog begins to clear. Sometimes things just- your thoughts are broken at the sight which greets you as you round the corner. The road narrows into a dirt track, running up a hill; and there, at the top, is the house.  House? Mansion is more appropriate, you think. Although the estate before you looks like it has seen better days, it is extremely impressive. You gaze up at two stories of elegance from a bygone time. This is the kind of place you have seen only in movies. You drive past a stone archway and pause to read an iron plate imbedded on the side: ORVIETO. So this place even has a name.
{para}You park your car about a hundred feet to the side of the house.  You shut off the engine, lean back in your seat, and yawn. Hopefully this won’t take too long. As you stare at the house, some other odd observations cross your mind, things that you hadn’t noticed before, perhaps due to fatigue. For one, an estate of this size must have at least several occupants; and yet as far as you can make out there are no other vehicles around and definitely no garage.  What’s more, from what you can observe (it is rather dark) there are no power lines in sight. There is light emanating from both floors, however. It doesn’t matter, you think as you lock your door. It makes a sort of sense when pieced together. This estate probably belongs to some hideously wealthy but eccentric old chap, who’s tired of being hit up for money, so he moved out here. I might do the same were I in his shoes. You open the trunk and pull out the two suitcases. As you start to make your way to the house, you are startled by a noise that suddenly breaks the stillness. But it is only a hooting owl. You chuckle to yourself as you slowly make your way to the front door. Little do you know what fate has in store for you. Tonight will be a night to remember…
{para}You climb up the steps leading to the front door and put down your suitcases. The wind has picked up, and you pause to take a deep breath.
There is an elaborate knocker in the middle of the door, fashioned in the shape of a gargoyle’s head (as far as you can tell). There is no sign of a bell-pull anywhere, so you rap
the door three times. The sound is surprisingly loud, and seems to reverberate throughout the house. A few moments later, you hear steps approaching the door

“Bless you,” she responds, beaming at your answer. “Now, this is what you must know. This entire house serves evil, Pravemi being the high priest of the order. To defeat him,
you must find a very special weapon, which is in a hidden room. You must find the location of this room and the password required to open it. Be on your guard at all times.
There are supernatural and infernal elements in this house. Not all is evil, however- there are those who would help you”. Her voice begins to fade. “Have courage!” she cries.
“Be selective of the areas that you choose to explore! Look for the cast--"…she is cut off in mid sentence as she begins to fade away. The door to the room swings open.

Both of the pictures were taken in black-and-white.  The first one is of the Count, or someone who looks exactly like him, standing in a room with several other men. They are wearing
Top hats and dressed in an elegant manner- vests and tails; they are also holding canes. Perhaps some kind of turn-of-the-century costume party? No, they look too authentic.
At any rate, the look on their faces is far from jovial- they are staring at the camera with cold, stern expressions. Something in their gaze is very disquieting. The other picture is
of a beautiful young woman with dark hair and light eyes. A small plaque is set at the bottom of the picture containing a message:

You throw yourself underneath the bed just as the door begins to open. Underneath it is very dusty and your eyes immediately begin to water, but you cup your hands over your mouth
and nose and try not to sneeze. Footsteps walk into the room and you can hear a conversation between two men: “…never been to one before. They say that only a few are accepted.”
“Yes. But I sometimes wonder abut the need to involve outsiders. Remember the raid? Surely, there will be another…” After this, the men speak in hushed tones and you cannot make out
their conversation. They walk to the center of the room and you can hear the sound of papers being shuffled. They converse for a few more minutes, then walk out of the room.
By this time you desperately need some fresh air and you start to crawl out from under the bed.

The wine is pale white in color; it tastes somewhat stronger then it looks. The Count asks you about yourself and your job. As you converse with him, you begin to feel somewhat lightheaded and dimwitted. The Count notices and remarks that you look quite tired and that perhaps you should turn in for the evening. You agree, but as you gaze at him you notice a darkness in his features and manner that you did not sense before. You stand up, and the room begins to spin. You retch violently, reaching out to grab the cart, but in the next moment you black out.
This is just as well, since you will never know what the Count and his minions do to your body! Next time, avoid white wine. Your brief adventure has ended.

You do not sleep well. Strange, disturbing images drift through your mind. You see yourself running in a black background, with hideous screaming sounds all around you.
Then, there are a man and a woman in white robes, stretching out their arms and beseeching you to listen; although their lips are moving no sounds come out. Then you see yourself again.
You open a door which only leads to another one; you open this to find still another. The doors only lead to more doors. Finally, you find yourself in the room of a house. There is a body
hanging from a rope tied around its neck. The rope is attached to a fan spinning around and around…you step forward to find that the body is…yourself!

After a few seconds, the playing begins again, only this time the notes are completely off key, as if a small child was banging on the keys at random. You are trying to decide what to do next
when a cat, coal black with aqua blue eyes, jumps over the top and lands on the floor in front of you. It gazes deeply into your eyes for a moment before bounding to the door and scratching
the surface. A glance around the room tells you that there is nothing here to search through. You open the door and the cat races down the hallway ahead and out of sight.

You run to the door to find that it is locked. “Maledetto” the corpse snarls. “Curse you!” It stands up and steps out of the box. Then, incredibly, it pulls off its own head
and flings it at you! You duck and an instant later it smashes into the door and rolls up to your feet. The ghastly thing is bleeding profusely from its nose, but its eyes are still
staring at you. “Curse you, curse you! Rot in hell!” it cries, and then tries to bite your foot. This is too much. Add another fear point. You kick the head and it goes flying across
the room and rebounds off the wall. You look up to see the headless corpse shambling towards you.

you are an outsider. You demand to know what is going on in the house, but they are uninterested in conversation. One of them silently draws a dagger from underneath his robes and attacks
you while the other runs out of the room. You are just getting around to dispatching your attacker before the door flies open and six more black-robed men rush in. You cannot hope to defeat

Aldo, wearing a blue sailor’s outfit, moves over to make room. Both children stare at you eagerly, as if you had a present for them. Somewhat at a loss, you ask them how they are doing and

rain falling outside faintly reaches your ears. You lean over to the nightstand to check your watch – it is still a few hours before dawn. You lean back on your bed, thinking that perhaps
the unfamiliar atmosphere has affected you. Yet, you can also sense that it is something more. But what can you do about it?

You pull the chair back and throw open all of the drawers. Sheets of blank white paper are strewn about, as well as pencils, pens, postage stamps, and – what’s this?
You lift up a personalized rubber stamp. You can’t quite make out the letters, so you stamp it on a sheet of paper read the work PRAVEMI in bold black ink. As this might prove useful,

You can hear footsteps walking into the room and the sound of muffled voices. You stand quietly, trying to make out what they are saying, but you cannot. As you stand there, a strange

The door opens up into some kind of storeroom. Drawers, shelves, and cabinets line the walls. You decide to search the room in the hope of finding something useful. The drawers contain

a sort of scurrying, scuttling sound. You wonder if the house is infested with – WHAT IS THAT? Something scuttles across the mantle above the fireplace. You instinctively draw back.

The door slowly opens, and a youngish looking man with curly brown hair stands before you. You examine each other silently for a few moments “Yes?” he finally asks. “How may I be of service?”
You inform him that you are here to give the presentation. When he continues to look at you quizzically, you hand him the confirmation slip. As he is examining this, another voice drifts out
from inside the house. “Who is it, {Character:Onoffrio}?” This sounds like it’s from an older man, and your assumption is confirmed when a tall, middle-aged man walks up to the entrance. He has coal-black eyes,
a friendly face, and black hair streaked with gray, which he wears slicked back. The young man steps aside. “It is my honor to present {Character:Pravemi}, Count of Orvieto, his most esteemed…” {Character:Pravemi} waves a
hand and {Character:Onoffrio} falls silent. “Now then, my friend, what may we do for you?” he asks politely. {Character:Onoffrio} hands him the slip and the Count examines it.
His brow rises in surprise. “My friend, I am afraid there has been an unfortunate misunderstanding.
We were not expecting you until morning!” You protest, detailing your long trip and general inconvenience. “I understand your frustration, my friend,” replies the Count, “but I am expecting
visitors early tomorrow, and they must be present as well. Please, come inside and perhaps we can reach a mutually satisfactory settlement.”

Turning to your right, you walk up to the door to find that it is marked BAMBINI. You place your ear up against it and can faintly make out a pair of high-pitched voices that seem to
be giggling and laughing. Curious, you open the door a crack and peer inside. The room contains a bed, a table, and a closet lined with a mirror. Several candelabrums stand on the table,
providing a glow strong enough to illuminate the entire area. In the center of the room, on a rug, two children sit together. The boy and girl are laughing while they play with some
cloth dolls.

As you walk over to the bureau, there is a sudden noise behind you. You wheel around, brandishing your weapon (if you have one)…but there is nothing. You glance over to the mirror and your
heart skips a beat. Your reflection is gone!  Before you can do anything else, you feel a tap on your shoulder. You spin around, to be confronted by an image of yourself! This thing is
identical to you in every way, save for its blood red eyes and a horrible grin. {Effect: increase(fear, 2)} __You gained 2 Fear point for this shock__ {/Effect}.

The {Character:Pravemi|Count} walks back into the room from a side hallway. “Once again, I ask for your pardon, my friend.” You assure him that it was no trouble and he smiles
before glancing down to his watch. “It is late, and in only a few hours you must be up. Onoffrio will show you to your room. Good night.” You thank him again and then follow Onoffrio upstairs.
The second story of the estate is a vast connection of hallways that are lit at regularly spaced intervals by lamps mounted to the walls. You pass several doors containing brass nameplates.
At last, you arrive at an unmarked door at the end of a hallway. It leads into a cozy room containing a bed that is made with crisp, satin sheets. A small nightstand is a few feet away containing a
mirror, a glass, a pitcher of water, and a small tub of ice. Onoffrio bids you good night and closes the door as he leaves. You lay your clothes by the bed and climb underneath the sheets.
You can hear the sprinkling of rain outside the window as you drift off to sleep.

Before you can react, he draws his free hand across his neck. Blood immediately begins to gush out. You step back in disgust as his hand flops to the ground, revealing a small pocket blade hidden
in his palm. You shake your head in disbelief.

You have been following the lighted tunnel for several meters when it takes a sharp turn to the right. You follow the turn and immediately stop when you are confronted – oddly enough –
with a gate, which bars your way. Before you even know what to think of this, a harsh voice barks out to you from the other side: “What is your business here at this hour?” Stunned,
you offer no reply. The voice calls out again: “If you have a reason to be here, then you know the process. What color is Orion’s belt?” You are left to ponder this strange question
and can only conclude that it is some kind of code. Do you know the answer to this question? If you do, take each letter of the word that is your answer and convert it into a number

The books are set in a plain black binding. They are written in a strange, unfamiliar language, somewhat similar to Latin, as far as you can tell. Flipping through the pages, you spot several
disturbing illustrations – faceless beings, writhing on the ground as if in great pain; an opened box with a whirlpool of ghastly clawed things (demons?) springing out; and one of a robed man
holding a star shaped crystal that seems to be shooting out a bolt of searing light straight at a group of hideous and evil looking beings standing nearby. You wonder what these books are about.

You are trying to decide what to do next when the door opposite is flung open and a short, middle-aged man with sandy blonde hair enters the room. He is obviously preoccupied with some matter of
great importance; in his haste he fails to even notice you at first as he rummages through one of the cloaks. With a satisfied chuckle, he pulls out a vial from one of the pockets and slips it into
his own. He then begins to don one of the other robes when he notices you. He jumps back as if he’d seen a ghost. “Who are you?” he rasps, eyes blazing. At your hesitant reply, he suddenly pulls out

provides the source of the light. Having come this far, you decide to open the door. Turning the knob, you find that it is unlocked; however you have to exert strong pressure to push the door open.

The situation is very unnerving. {Effect: increase(fear, 2)} __You gained 2 Fear point__ {/Effect}. She examines you solemnly for a few moments, as if sizing you up.

back as you screech away. What an evil place, you think to yourself. Someone else can be the hero. I’m going home… Something rises out of the back seat and grabs you. Your car flies
